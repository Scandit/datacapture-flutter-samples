# Scandit Flutter Samples

This repository contains both simple and advanced samples that show you how use various features of the Scandit Data Capture SDK. The simple samples allow you to get going quickly, while the advanced samples show you how to use additional settings and setup the scanner for the best performance and user experience.

### Single Scanning (Barcode Capture)

## **Pre-Built Barcode Scanning Components**

Scandit offers building blocks that can be integrated in just a few lines of code. The pre-built camera UI has been designed and user-tested to achieve superior process efficiency, ergonomics and usability.

### Counting and Receiving in Batches (MatrixScan Count)

MatrixScan Count is an out-of-the-box scan and count solution for counting and receiving multiple items at once, in which user interface (UI) elements and interactions are built into a workflow.

### Scan One of Many (Barcode Selection)

Barcode Selection is a pre-built component that provides a UI for selecting the right code when codes are crowded (and cannot be selected programmatically).

Consider Barcode Selection when **accuracy** is more important than **speed**.

- **Aim to Select** allows you to select one barcode at a time using an aimer, and tapping to confirm the selection. It is especially convenient for one-handed operation.

- **Tap to select** is quicker when you need to select several barcodes, as when reordering from a catalog where barcodes are close together (yep, those are teeth).
